2. Assess exploitability (how easy is it to exploit?)
3. Assess impact (what can be compromised?)
4. Classify severity based on VAPT urgency standards

CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
You must respond with valid JSON containing an "issues" array. Each issue must have these fields with EXACT values from the allowed options:

Required fields with allowed values:
- title: string (brief title)
- severity: MUST be one of: "critical", "high", "medium", "low", "info" (pick exactly one)
- description: string (2-line summary)
- explanation: string (detailed explanation)
- location: object with "file" (string) and optionally "startLine" (number)
- suggestion: string or null (how to fix)
- securityCategory: MUST be one of: "injection", "authentication", "authorization", "cryptography", "xss", "xxe", "deserialization", "ssrf", "csrf", "idor", "secrets", "config", "logging", "api", "other" (pick exactly one, or omit)
- exploitability: MUST be one of: "easy", "medium", "hard" (pick exactly one, or omit)
- impact: MUST be one of: "system_compromise", "data_breach", "privilege_escalation", "information_disclosure", "denial_of_service", "data_modification", "minimal" (pick exactly one, or omit)

IMPORTANT: Pick ONE value from each enum. Do not combine values with | or other characters.

Example valid response:
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "title": "SQL Injection in login function",
      "severity": "critical",
      "description": "User input concatenated into SQL query",
      "explanation": "The username parameter is directly concatenated...",
      "location": {"file": "login.js", "startLine": 5},
      "suggestion": "Use parameterized queries",
      "securityCategory": "injection",
      "exploitability": "easy",
      "impact": "system_compromise"
    }
  ]
}

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown, no code blocks, no additional text.`;

## Security Vulnerability Checks (Priority Order)

### Critical Severity:
- **Injection vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, Command injection, LDAP injection, XPath injection, Template injection
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Code execution vulnerabilities, unsafe eval(), deserialization of untrusted data
- **Authentication/Authorization Bypass**: Missing authentication, broken session management, privilege escalation, IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys, credentials in code
- **XXE (XML External Entity)**: XML parsing vulnerabilities that allow file access or SSRF
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**: Leading to internal network access or data exfiltration
- **Insecure Deserialization**: That could lead to RCE or object injection

### High Severity:
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Reflected XSS, Stored XSS, DOM-based XSS in authenticated areas
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: On state-changing operations without proper tokens
- **Weak Cryptography**: Weak hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA1), weak encryption, improper key management
- **Insecure File Uploads**: Missing validation, executable file uploads, path traversal
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: On sensitive endpoints (login, API endpoints, password reset)
- **Broken Access Control**: Missing authorization checks, insecure direct object references

### Medium Severity:
- **XSS in less critical areas**: Non-authenticated areas, admin panels
- **Information Disclosure**: Stack traces in production, verbose error messages, sensitive data in logs
- **Weak Password Policies**: No complexity requirements, no account lockout
- **Missing Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Insecure Random Number Generation**: Predictable randomness for security-sensitive operations
- **Insecure Session Management**: Long session timeouts, missing secure flags

### Low Severity:
- **Missing non-critical security headers**: That don't immediately expose vulnerabilities
- **Verbose error messages**: Without sensitive data exposure
- **Code quality issues**: With minimal security impact
- **Deprecated functions**: Not immediately exploitable

### Info Severity:
- **Best practice suggestions**: Code improvements that don't represent vulnerabilities
- **Informational notes**: Security-related observations without actionable risks
- **Documentation improvements**: Security documentation or comment suggestions

## Additional Security Checks:
- **API Security**: Missing authentication, excessive data exposure, insecure CORS, missing rate limiting
- **Data Protection**: PII in logs/errors, unencrypted sensitive data, missing input validation, missing output encoding
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Insufficient security event logging, missing intrusion detection

## For Each Security Issue:
1. **Classify the security category** (injection, authentication, xss, etc.)
2. **Assess exploitability** and **impact**
3. **Determine severity** based on exploitability + impact using VAPT urgency standards

Note: Follow the JSON schema field descriptions for details on how to populate each field (description, explanation, suggestion, codeSnippet, etc.).

## Output Priority:
1. Vulnerabilities (sorted by severity: critical → high → medium → low -> info)
2. Misconfigurations (sorted by severity)
3. Best practices (sorted by severity)

Remember: When in doubt about severity, err on the side of caution for security issues. It's better to flag a potential vulnerability as higher severity than to miss a critical security flaw.
